# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Twilight Book Application with React

###

We began the applications and the learnings with **React** and **Vite**. And to sharpen it a little more **Front-End** and the **UI**/
**UX**, we will start an application from the book of **Crepúsculo**. 

###

Since we are close to Halloween, and the Twilight saga has a dark and terrifying theme, we decided to make this small application with 3 pages:

###

- About the Author;
- About the Work;
- Curiosities.

---

All screens, responsiveness, and color palette are prototyped in Figma, languages and tools are mentioned right below.

###

Basically, the book talks about the Twilight saga, where it tells the story of **Isabella Swan**, a 17-year-old young woman who is responsible and shy and has never experienced great emotions before.

###

Isabella moves from her city called **Phoenix**, where she lived with her mother, **Renée**, and her husband, **Phill**, to the small rainy town of **Forks**, in the state of Washington, in order to live with her father, **Charlie Swan**, the local police chief. A move that marked the beginning of a new phase in her life...
